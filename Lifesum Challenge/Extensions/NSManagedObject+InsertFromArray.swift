     * MagicalRecord's MR_importFromArray uses MR_importFromObject which doesn't simply insert the new object,
     * but first tries to find another object with the same primary attribute and tries to update it.
     * Understandibly, this makes things extremely slow when importing lots of objects.
     *
     * Therefore I've created insertFromArray, which doesn't care about the object's primary attribute and
     * simply inserts all objects.
     * It should only be used when you're certain about your data's integrety.
